# Database Versioning:

<br/>Create a new migration:

npx sequelize-cli migration: generate --name create-tableName
```

<br/>Run all migrations:
```
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

<br/>Revert the most recent migration.
```
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo
```

<br/>Revert back to a specific migration
```
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all --to XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-create-posts.js
```

<br/>Create a seed file which will add a demo data to our table.
```
npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name nameHere
```

<br/>In last step you created a seed file; however, it has not been committed to the database. To do that we run a simple command.
```
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```
